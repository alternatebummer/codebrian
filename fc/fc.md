  - *Island of Lost Souls,* like Moreau himself, is overly concerned with getting a man to unleash his sexual passion on a panther. Or is it... not concerned *enough?* In the House of Pain, isolated and soaked through with debauched fantasy, you will find the answers you seek... Very much the protoform of *Rocky Horror* and deserving of a watch with that in mind.

  - We're rooting for Rose (the Rooner herself), a woman so beguiling and flawless that she may as well be a metaphor for the resilient spirit of Ireland itself. So beguiling that she's involuntarily relocated to a hut in the woods, away from the zombie-like men of this town, who don't know how to sit back and let a 1940s barista live her life in different combinations of stockings, scarves, and coats. Thoreau writes in *Walden*, "I went to live in the woods because I wished to live deliberately." We have the pleasure of watching Rose share a hut with goats and birds for the middle-third of the movie, but does she enjoy the woods? How has she adapted? Did she name her woodland creature-friends? What kind of axe does she use to chop wood? What's her water catchment situation? Is she gardening? Who brings her candles and wine? Where's her .22? Where's the outhouse? Does she sing? Instead of thrilling me with answers to these questions, the movie pivots around a *Schrodinger's Baby Hypothesis.* Then, a truly ridiculous "twist" ending.

  - Rooney Mara plays a very *Gone Girl-esque* heroine (*villain????*) but never quite gets fully *Gone.* I'm watching along, waiting for her *Getting Gone*, but she hasn't the leverage. Actually, *Side Effects* itself is essentially *Gone Girl* without leverage. While it can't reach the heights, it's standing on the shoulders of *Pelican Brief* and *Primal Fear* and *Michael Clayton*; *Side Effects* is among the last of the great twisty mid-budget psychological thrillers where alienated adults topple the Jenga towers of their lives in the process of finding something out or getting busted.
