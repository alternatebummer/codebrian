# Joker

I'm a sucker for the cinematic "New York" energy we get from movies like Midnight Cowboy and Taxi Driver. I think we're getting a lot of that energy here from Todd Phillips. Joaquin gives an unique lead performance and the intervention of cable television calls back to awkward Late Show interviews with Harvey Pekar and Crispin Glover. Christine Chubbuck's on-air suicide also looms over this movie.

Also present is the deinstitutionalization of long-stay psychiatric hospitals in favour of short-term, behavioural/corrective therapy, the rise of pharmaceuticals intended for consumer markets, and (let's face it) homelessness and flat-out insanity resulting from a lack of support for high-risk folk. All of this is in the soup. Pretty ambitious for a batman movie, honestly. And there's a whole class struggle aspect.

## The moralization of health

I have to say, I'm also a sucker for the overt, textual conflation of health with moral virtue. This comes to us via Aristotle. The critical analysis comes from Nietzsche. Nietzsche equated a fall from health as a crime with medicine being a carceral/punitive measure pending the subject's return to "good health." Flick spends much of this movie wondering if being good is something he cares about.

References to our own society and big questions about mental health seem to pour out from every apartment window. Phillips takes the time to set up this world and then inserts a character into it who, while confused, sees it, and is haunted by it. One of the interesting confusions we see Arthur Fleck navigate, for example, has to do with whether he wants to be a lovable entertainer or an avenging killer. We don't know either, but we understand how he has come to this crossroads.

What I find most interesting about Joker is the way it tempts us to see him as a figure that's fallen into unhealth, fallen from grace, that's lost the plot, gone over the deep end, all that stuff. He even fully integrates the clown face into his persona, which appears to indicate a permanent split, a permanent depersonalization. His interactions with a certain family re-enforce this read. They view Arthur as an invader, an unwanted creepo. We're perhaps meant to agree when we see him with his finger tooling around literally inside the mouth of a child. A light spoiler follows.

## The paranoid/schizoid trope

His character arc runs counter to this, however. Arthur begins as a fractured, schizoid personality and ends as an integrated, fully realized individual. The point is driven home when his impulse to perform for an audience collides with the odd ballet that he performs when he's alone. Whereas Nolan's Joker is a split figure, is a mask, and is a mirror for batman, Phillips' Joker is whole.

## All the more reason to watch Midnight Cowboy

For me, this is a 3 star movie. Go see Midnight Cowboy if you want the 5 star version of Joker. Much of the dialogue is somewhat contrived and a few too many things happen between the beginning and the end to hold my attention. Further, this isn't a great reflection of the DSM or even my own lived experience with depression, anxiety or even lonerism. Folk seeking a realistic depiction of mental health must seek elsewhere. I must, however, give credit where credit is due. It's none the less a smouldering, saturated origin story that weirdly takes on a lot more subject matter than anyone asked for.
